# Poker Splitwise

This repository contains the code for a website I built to help my friends and I keep track of our poker debts to each other. It is based off the splitwise app, in that it collects a list of 'debts' and 'credits' and works out the easiest way for people to settle payments with as few individual transactions as possible. It differs in that the debts and credits are entered by recording the result of individual poker games. Here, all the buy-ins are recorded as debts, and then credits assigned to the winner(s) of the game (who may have agreed to split the pot unequally). This is easier than the required Splitwise procedure, where every single buy-in would need to be recorded as a separate debt, and it would also be annoying to work out who that debt should be credited to in the case of multiple winners.
